      <p>This Note describes CoverageJSON, a data format for describing "coverage" data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and provides an overview of its design and capabilities. The primary intended purpose of the format is to enable data transfer between servers and web browsers, to support the development of interactive, data-driven web applications. "Coverage" data is a term that encompasses many kinds of data whose properties vary with space, time and other dimensions, including (but not limited to) satellite imagery, weather forecasts and river gauge measurements. We describe the motivation and objectives of the format, and provide a high-level overview of its structure and semantics. We compare CoverageJSON with other "coverage" formats and data models and provide links to tools and libraries that can help users to produce and consume data in this format. This Note does not attempt to describe the full CoverageJSON specification in detail: this is available at <a href="https://covjson.org/">the project website</a>.</p>

      <p>This is a largely complete document and is published as a First Published Working Draft.  Work remaining includes: adding references, adding a section on how this document relates to the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices, and any specific improvements in response to feedback.</p>
      <p>The editors anticipate one further release of the document in approximately June 2017.</p>
      <p><strong>For OGC</strong> This is a Public Draft of a document prepared

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section  id="coverage">
        <h3>What is a Coverage?</h3>
        <p>The term "coverage" is defined in ISO19123 (REF) as a "feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain". In other words, a coverage maps points in space and time to data values. For example, an aerial photograph can be modelled as a coverage that maps positions on the ground to colours. A river gauge maps points in time to flow values. A weather forecast maps points in space and time to values of temperature, wind speed, humidity and so forth.</p>
        <p class="note">Sometimes we see the word “coverage” used synonymously with “gridded data” or “raster data” but this isn’t really accurate. One can see from the above paragraph that non-gridded data (like a river gauge measurement) can also be modelled as coverages. Nevertheless, we often observe a bias toward gridded data in discussions (and software) that concern coverages.)</p>
      </section>

      <section id="existingmodels">
        <h3>Existing Coverage representations</h3>
        <p>The ISO19123 specification defines an <em>abstract</em> data model for representing the data and metadata needed to encode coverage data. This abstract model can be instantiated in many different concrete formats. The OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) specification (REF) describes a <em>concrete</em>, directly instantiable data model and XML serialisation based on the Geography Markup Language (GML). Other serialisations have been defined, sometimes by retrospectively mapping existing binary data formats to the ISO19123 abstract data model (e.g. NetCDF, REF Nativi et al). Version 1.1 (<strong>TODO check this</strong>) of the CIS specification supports a JSON serialization, which is created through a direct translation from GML types to JSON objects. (We provide a brief comparison of CIS-JSON with CoverageJSON <a href="#cis">below</a>.)</p>
      </section>

      <section id="motivation">
        <h3>Motivation and objectives</h3>
        <p>This document describes the CoverageJSON format and explains how it is well-suited to representation of spatial data on the Web: with a number of advantages for use in a web context, in comparison to alternative established approaches for serialisation of coverage data. It is a good match to the Use Case Requirements  [[SDW-UCR]] and Best Practices [[SDW-BP]] of the Spatial Data on the Web working group.</p>  
<p>Serialisations (i.e. data formats) based upon community-specific binary formats and complex XML schemas provide usability challenges for the development of web applications. Javascript libraries do not always exist for these formats, and the formats are complex, requiring specialist knowledge on the part of the web developer. Our overall aim is to <strong>make it easier for web developers to consume coverage data in their applications</strong>, minimising the need for prior knowledge about community-specific data formats.</p>
        <p>Therefore our objective in this work was to develop a well-structured, consistent and easy-to-use JSON format for coverage data that fulfils the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Able to encode many different kinds of coverage, including multidimensional grids, timeseries, vertical profiles, polygon-based coverages, point clouds and more.</li>
          <li>Able to encode both continuous-valued data (e.g. temperature) and categorical data (e.g. land cover classification).</li>
          <li>Able to encode geospatial data using a variety of coordinate reference systems.</li>
          <li>Able to encode both scalar data (e.g. temperature) and vector data (e.g. velocities).</li>
          <li>Able to encode data with quality information, e.g. numerical uncertainties and quality flags.</li>
          <li>Clear and readable, using idiomatic JSON concepts.</li>
          <li>Use a minimal set of encoding rules, to avoid complicating the development of client code.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section  id="overview">
      <h2>Overview of CoverageJSON</h2>
      <p>The full specification for CoverageJSON is published on <a href="https://covjson.org/spec/">GitHub</a>,
         which also records all discussions that led to the design decisions in the format.
         The specification is split up into two documents:
         the core part, and a set of optional <a href="https://covjson.org/domain-types/">domain types</a> that ease interoperability.</p>

      <section id="structure">
      <h3 id="highLevelStructure">High-level structure</h3>
      <p>In CoverageJSON, a Coverage consists of the following objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn>Domain</dfn> (exactly one), which encodes the set of points in space and time for which we have data values.</li>
        <li>A set of <dfn>Range</dfn> objects (one per scalar quantity), holding actual data values.</li>
        <li>A set of <dfn>Parameter</dfn> objects (one per scalar quantity), describing the data values.</li>
        <li>An optional set of <dfn>ParameterGroup</dfn> objects, which describe any semantic associations between Parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A sample skeleton document encoding a three-dimensional gridded Coverage with two Parameters (sea surface temperature and sea ice area fraction) is shown here:</p>
      <pre>
{
  "type" : "Coverage",
  "domain" : {
    "type": "Domain",
    "domainType" : "Grid",
    "axes" : {
      "x" : { /* Coordinate values */ },
      "y" : {                         },
      "t" : {                         }
    },
    "referencing" : [
      /* Coordinate referencing information */
    ]
  },
  "parameters" : {
    "SST"     : { /* Description of temperature values */ },
    "sea_ice" : { ... }
  },
  "ranges" : {
    "SST"     : { /* Encoding of temperature values, or link(s) */ },
    "sea_ice" : { ... }
  }
}
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="domain">
      <h3>Encoding the Domain</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#domain-objects">Domain</a> is a collection of named orthogonal <dfn>axes</dfn> containing coordinate values, coupled with information about how to reference these values to one or more real-world coordinate reference systems. An axis can contain simple numeric values like latitudes or longitudes but can also contain composite values like tuples or polygons.</p>
      <p>The following is a complete example of a simple grid domain with longitude, latitude, and time axes, using the WGS84 longitude-latitude coordinate reference system and the Gregorian calendar:</p>
      <pre>
{
  "type" : "Domain",
  "domainType" : "Grid",
  "axes": {
    "x" : { "start": -179.5, "stop": 179.5, "num": 360 },
    "y" : { "start": 89.5, "stop": -89.5, "num": 180 },
    "t" : { "values": ["2001", "2002", "2003"] }
  },
  "referencing": [{
    "coordinates": ["x","y"],
    "system": {
      "type": "GeographicCRS",
      "id": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84"
    }
  }, {
    "coordinates": ["t"],
    "system": {
      "type": "TemporalRS",
      "calendar": "Gregorian"
    }
  }]
}
      </pre>
      <p>Note that difference CRSs can be associated with different combinations of axes, providing a very flexible model that allows complex data to be encoded without the need to create composite CRSs. Axis values can also be categorical in nature (instead of numeric), enabling data values to be associated with entities that are not spatiotemporal coordinates.</p>

      <p class="note">This closely mirrors the structure of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a>, in which orthogonal <dfn>dimensions</dfn> are combined to form the domain of the data cube. (A "dimension" in the data cube corresponds with an "axis" in CoverageJSON.) Therefore, although a formal mapping process has yet to be performed, we expect that interoperability between the RDF Data Cube and CoverageJSON is achievable. The RDF Data Cube specification does not explicitly support spatiotemporal dimensions, but this is addressed in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sdw/qb4st/">QB4ST</a> extensions. <strong>TODO: is there a better way of citing QB and QB4ST?</strong></p>

      <p>This mechanism allows for a huge variety of domain structures to be encoded, from multidimensional grids to one-dimensional trajectories through four-dimensional space. To ease the burden on clients, CoverageJSON allows an optional <dfn>domain type</dfn> property to be defined (see the example above). If the data provider specifies that the domain is of a known type, the client then knows in more detail what to expect when the domain is inspected. For example, if the domain type is "Grid", the client knows that the domain MUST have axes that are called <code>"x"</code> and <code>"y"</code> (corresponding to the two horizontal spatial dimensions) and MAY have axes called <code>"z"</code> and <code>"t"</code> (corresponding respectively to the vertical and temporal dimensions). A number of <a href="https://covjson.org/domain-types/">common domain types</a> are specified and there is a <a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-types">mechanism for data providers to define and register their own types</a>. Note that in a typical document, short names (<code>"Grid"</code>, <code>"PointSeries"</code>, <code>"Trajectory"</code>, etc.) are used to indicate the domain type, but in fact these are full URIs in disguise - this becomes apparent when viewing CoverageJSON document as RDF using the JSON-LD context (see <a href="#rdf">below</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="datavalues">
      <h3>Encoding of data values</h3>
      <p>Data in CoverageJSON is held in Range objects, which represent multi-dimensional arrays.
         There are two subtypes of Range objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An <dfn>NdArray</dfn> object encodes the array in its entirety, in line. In fact, the data values are encoded in a
          <em>one-dimensional</em> array, with a <code>shape</code> property that defines how to "unwrap" the one-dimensional array into
          a multi-dimensional one.</li>
        <li>A <dfn>TiledNdArray</dfn> object splits up a multi-dimensional array into several parts and links to
         those parts via URI templates (RFC 6570) where each part is an NdArray object.
         A single TiledNdArray may define several ways of splitting up the array (each way is a <em>tileset</em>), to cater for different access scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Readers may wonder why multi-dimensional arrays are not encoded as nested arrays in CoverageJSON. Nested arrays
        (i.e. "arrays of arrays") are harder to manipulate and reason over, since there is no guarantee that the inner arrays are of a consistent length.
        With a one-dimensional array it is easy to verify that <code>array.length</code> matches the required number of elements, defined by the shape of
        the domain and the numbers in the <code>shape</code> property.
        In addition, Javascript engines can treat one-dimensional arrays more efficiently than nested arrays. APIs can be provided to extract slices in any
        dimension as if the array were truly multi-dimensional. This mirrors the approach taken by libraries such as <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a>.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of an NdArray:</p><pre>
{
  "type" : "NdArray",
  "dataType": "float",
  "axisNames": ["t", "y", "x"],
  "shape": [1, 90, 90],
  "values": [
    12.2, 12.0, 13.3, ...
    /* 8100 numbers (1*90*90) in row-major order */
  ]
}</pre>

      <h4>Support for large datasets</h4>
      <p>For reasons of efficiency and convenience, data providers may prefer not to specify the range objects for all parameters inline in the same CoverageJSON document. In this case, there are two options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For some or all parameters, create a separate JSON document containing an NdArray, which holds the values of that parameter. Then insert a link to this document in the Coverage document in place of the inline NdArray.</li>
        <li>Additionally, the individual arrays may be split up into tiles, in which the values of each parameter are encoded in multiple JSON documents, each containing an NdArray.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The following illustrates how a coverage may be split up into a particular tileset:</p>
      <img src="covjson-tiling.png" width="500"/>
      <pre>
{
  "type" : "TiledNdArray",
  "dataType": "float",
  "axisNames": ["t", "y", "x"],
  "shape": [3, 180, 360],
  "tileSets": [{
    "tileShape": [1, 90, 90],
    "urlTemplate": "http://example.com/{t}/{y}/{x}.covjson"
  }]
}
      </pre>

      <p>Each tile is an NdArray, encoded as above.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="parameters">
      <h3>Encoding of Parameter metadata</h3>
      <p>Data values are described in CoverageJSON using Parameter objects. These contain a minimal set of metadata needed to do something useful with the data values: a definition of the quantity being recorded (e.g. relative humidity, potential temperature, reflectance) and the units of measure in which the data values are expressed.</p>
      <p>The sample JSON document below shows a Parameter object describing the sea surface temperature variable from the above <a href="#highLevelStructure">skeleton JSON</a>.</p>
      <pre>
"SST" : {
  "type" : "Parameter",
  "observedProperty" : {
    "id" : "http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name/sea_surface_temperature/",
    "label" : {
      "en" : "Sea Surface Temperature",
      "de" : "Meeresoberflächentemperatur"
    },
    "description" : {
      "en" : "The temperature of sea water near the surface",
      "de" : "Die Temperatur des Meerwassers nahe der Oberfläche"
    }
  },
  "unit" : {
    "label" : {
      "en" : "Degree Celsius",
      "de" : "Grad Celsius"
    },
    "symbol": {
      "value" : "Cel",
      "type" : "http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/UCUM/"
    }
  }
}
</pre>
      <p>Note that the main features of the Parameter metadata in this example are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a URI link to the definition of the parameter in question,</li>
        <li>a strongly-typed unit string, using UCUM encoding rules,</li>
        <li>internationalisation of human-readable strings (labels).</li>
      </ul>
<p>Other metadata, such as provenance information, is not part of the core CoverageJSON specification, but can be recorded via the <a href="#extensions">extension mechanism</a>.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="documents">
      <h3>CoverageJSON documents</h3>
      <p>A single CoverageJSON document can contain one of the following types of object:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A single Coverage</li>
        <li>A collection of Coverages</li>
        <li>A standalone Domain</li>
        <li>An NdArray (or TiledNdArray? <strong>TODO</strong> check this)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The top-level object within a document contains a “type” property that identifies the type of the object that it contains. Documents may be linked to other documents; in this way data providers can ensure that each individual document is of a manageable size, with large datasets being partitioned among a number of linked documents. (See "Support for large datasets" above.)</p>
    </section>

    <section id="rdf">
      <h3>CoverageJSON, JSON-LD and RDF</h3>
      <p>To a limited extent, a CoverageJSON document can be converted into RDF through the use of a JSON-LD context header. The extent to which this is possible is discussed in REF (<strong>TODO:</strong> insert link to Montreal paper).</p>
      <p>We did not consider that coversion to RDF should be a primary goal: we focused mainly on simplicity and readability of the format, under the assumption that few of the target users (web developers) would require a pure RDF representation of the data. Enabling a full conversion to RDF would require complicating the format (mainly for technical reasons including limitations of JSON-LD). Also, RDF is an unsuitable format for large arrays of data and so the Domain and Range would not convert efficiently.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, CoverageJSON makes frequent use of URIs to denote key concepts, such as units, observed properties, coordinate reference systems, domain types and links to other CoverageJSON documents. Clients can make use of these to detect these concepts unambiguously, whether or not they perform a translation to RDF.</p>

      <p>By using the <a href="https://covjson.org/context.jsonld">canonical CoverageJSON JSON-LD context</a>,
         it is possible to convert the <a href="#parameters">above Parameter</a> directly into RDF triples:</p>

</pre>
<p class="note">An interesting area of future work would be to define two-way mappings between CoverageJSON and an RDF Data Cube representation (using the QB4ST extensions to the latter). As noted above, there are a number of similarities between the two representations, and defining such mappings should be possible.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="extensions">
      <h3>Extension points</h3>
      <p>CoverageJSON allows data providers to extend the format in a controlled manner. The possible extensions that can be defined by users include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-members">Custom properties</a> (e.g. high-level metadata such as licence information)</li>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-types">Custom domain types</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-types">Custom data types</a> for axes</li>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-types">Custom referencing system types</a> (e.g. <a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov">HEALPix</a> grids)</li>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#custom-types">Different grammars for encoding unit symbols</a> (e.g. UDUNITS, REF)</li>
        <li><a href="https://covjson.org/spec/#coverage-objects">Alternative encodings for range values</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each case we recommend that URIs be used to denote these extensions (and to point to definitions), to avoid the possibility of clashes between extensions.</p>

The <a href="http://cfconventions.org">Climate and Forecast</a> conventions are the pre-eminent conventions for geospatial data. NetCDF files that conform to these conventions are known as "CF-NetCDF files".)</p>
      <p>The overall structure of CoverageJSON is quite close to that of NetCDF (REF), consisting essentially of a set of orthogonal domain axes that can be combined in different ways. One major difference is that in CoverageJSON, there is an explicit Domain object, whereas in NetCDF the domain is specified implicitly by linking data variables with coordinate variables. One consequence of this is that NetCDF files can contain several domains and hence several Coverages. A NetCDF file could therefore be converted to a single Coverage or a Coverage Collection in CoverageJSON.</p>

      <h3>OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS)</h3>
      <p>The overall concepts of CoverageJSON are close to those of the ISO19123 standard (REF) and the OGC standard Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS, REF), which specialises ISO19123. The main points of difference are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CIS uses a different set of rules for gridded and non-gridded data, whereas CoverageJSON uses a single consistent set.</li>
        <li>CIS allows each Coverage to have exactly one CRS, whereas CoverageJSON allows different CRSs to be applied to different sets of coordinates in the domain (e.g. one CRS for x and y, and another CRS for z).</li>
        <li>The most recent version of CIS defines a JSON encoding that uses a near-literal translation of GML structures into JSON. CoverageJSON does not use GML as its starting point.</li>

      <h3>TimeseriesML</h3>
      <div  class="issue"  data-number="101">Describe relationship to other data models, such as TimeseriesML.</div>
      <p><strong>TODO expand this</strong>, but the main difference is probably that TimeseriesML allows for a number of ways to associate values of time to data values: a data value may represent an accumulation or average of a quantity over time, and the time values in the domain may mark the start, end or middle of the time period in question.</p>

However, it is primarily intended as a format for data exchange over wide-area networks, not an archive format. Therefore it is probably unlikely that the designer of a computational model would choose to read or write data in CoverageJSON directly. Tools to convert to and from NetCDF (a more common archive format) are <a href="https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/pycovjson">under development</a>.</td>
